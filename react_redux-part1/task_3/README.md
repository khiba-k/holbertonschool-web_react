**Package to install:**

- reduxjs/toolkit
- react-redux

**Requirements:**

Your `src` folder must follow the above structure (and even empty the new files must be included in your project structure)

Your React application works as expected

All your unit tests PASS

### 2.

In this task, you will create a Redux slice called authSlice to manage the authentication state of a React application. This slice will handle user login and logout functionality, storing the user’s email, password, and authentication status.

In the `authSlice.js` file:

Create an `initialState` object to represent the initial authentication state. This object should include:

- A user object with the following properties:
  - email: Initialized as an empty string
  - password: Initialized as an empty string
  - An isLoggedIn property: Initialized as false

Create the `authSlice` object using the Redux Toolkit `createSlice` function to create the slice, and ensure that:

- The slice is named `auth`
- The `initialState` object is passed as the default state of the slice
- The slice includes the following reducers:

  - `login` Reducer:
    - Updates the state with the user’s email and password from the action payload
    - Sets isLoggedIn to true
  - `logout` Reducer:
    - Resets the user object’s email and password to their initial values
    - Sets isLoggedIn to false

Don’t forget to export the authSlice `reducer` as default export and the `actions` as named exports

**Tip:**

The logout action is always a state reset, there’s no need for any payload

**Tests:**

You need to install the package [axios-mock-adapter](/rltoken/03-ZHNLuGVkhrX_CCY-CPg "axios-mock-adapter") to simulate mocking requests

Check that the `authSlice`:

- Returns the correct initial state by default
- Updates the state correctly when the login action is dispatched:
  - The user object’s email and password should match the values from the action payload
  - The isLoggedIn property should be set to true.
- Resets the state correctly when the logout action is dispatched:
  - The user object’s email and password should be reset to empty string
  - The isLoggedIn property should be set to false.

**Requirements:**

Your React application core features and state follow remains intact and works as expected

Your new unit tests PASS

No console warns or errors

No lint errors

### 3.

In this task, you will create a Redux slice called `notificationsSlice` to manage the notifications state of a React application.

This slice will handle fetching notifications, marking notifications as read, and controlling the visibility of the notifications drawer.

In the `notificationsSlice.js` file:

Create an `initialState` object to represent the initial notifications state. This object should include:

- A `notifications` array: Initialized as an empty array.
- A `displayDrawer` boolean: Initialized as true.

Set Up the API Configuration:

- Define a constant `API_BASE_URL` to store the base URL of your API (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
- Create an `ENDPOINTS` object to store the API endpoints. For this task, include:
  - notifications: The endpoint to fetch notifications (e.g., `${API_BASE_URL}/notifications.json`)

Create and export the `fetchNotifications` Async Thunk:

- Use the `createAsyncThunk` function to handle fetching notifications from the API
- Provide the action type string `'notifications/fetchNotifications'` as the first argument to createAsyncThunk
- The thunk should:
  - Fetch the notifications from the ENDPOINTS.notifications endpoint
  - Update the notification with id `3` to include the latest notification from the `getLatestNotification` utility function
  - Return the updated notifications array.

Create the `notificationsSlice` object using the Redux Toolkit `createSlice` function, and ensure that:

- The slice is named `notifications`
- The `initialState` object is passed as the default state of the slice
- The slice includes the following reducers:

  - `markNotificationAsRead` Reducer:
    - Removes a notification from the notifications array based on its id
    - Log to console the removed notification id (the same you applied in the `markNotificationAsRead` handler before)
  - `showDrawer` Reducer:
    - Sets displayDrawer to true
  - `hideDrawer` Reducer:
    - Sets displayDrawer to false.

- The slice includes an `extraReducers` section to handle the `fetchNotifications` async thunk:

  - Updates the notifications array with the fetched data when the fetchNotifications thunk is fulfilled.

- Don’t forget to export the `notificationsSlice` reducer as the default export and the actions (`markNotificationAsRead`, `showDrawer`, `hideDrawer`) as named exports.

**Tip:**

- The `showDrawer` and `hideDrawer` actions are simple state updates, so there’s no need for a payload.

**Tests:**

Check that the `notificationsSlice`:

- Returns the correct initial state by default
- fetches notifications data correctly
- Removes a notification correctly when the `markNotificationAsRead` action is dispatched
- Toggles the `displayDrawer` state correctly when the `showDrawer` and `hideDrawer` actions are dispatched

**Requirements:**

Your React application’s core features and state management remain intact and work as expected

Your new unit tests PASS

No console warnings or errors

No lint errors.

### 4.

In this task, you will create a Redux slice called `coursesSlice` to manage the courses state of a React application.

This slice will handle fetching courses from an API and resetting the courses state when the user logs out.

Create an `initialState` object to represent the initial courses state. This object should include:

- A courses array: Initialized as an empty array
- Set Up the API Configuration:

Define a constant `API_BASE_URL` to store the base URL of your API (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) Create an ENDPOINTS object to store the API endpoints. For this task, include:

- courses: The endpoint to fetch courses (e.g., `${API_BASE_URL}/courses.json`)

Create and export the `fetchCourses` Async Thunk:

- Use the `createAsyncThunk` function to handle fetching courses from the API
- Provide the action type string `'courses/fetchCourses'` as the first argument to createAsyncThunk
- The thunk should:

  - Fetch the courses from the ENDPOINTS.courses endpoint
  - Return the fetched courses data.

Create the `coursesSlice`:

- Use the Redux Toolkit `createSlice` function to create the slice. Ensure that:

  - The slice is named `courses`
  - The `initialState` object is passed as the default state of the slice
  - The slice includes an `extraReducers` section to handle the fetchCourses async thunk:

    - Updates the courses array with the fetched data when the fetchCourses thunk is fulfilled

The slice listens for the `logout` action from the `authSlice` and resets the courses state to its initial value

Export the `coursesSlice` reducer as the default export

**Tests:**

Check that the `coursesSlice`:

- Returns the correct initial state by default
- fetches correctly the courses data
- resets the courses array to empty whenever the `logout` action is dispatched

**Requirements:**

Your React application’s core features and state management remain intact and work as expected

All your new unit tests PASS

No console warnings or errors

No lint errors

### 5.

In this task, you will create a root reducer for a Redux application using the `combineReducers` function from Redux Toolkit.

The root reducer will combine multiple individual reducers (slices) into a single reducer that manages the overall state of the application

Use the `combineReducers` function to combine the following reducers into a single `rootReducer`

The `rootReducer` should structure the state object such that each slice of state is nested under its corresponding key:

- `auth`: Contains the state managed by authReducer
- `notifications`: Contains the state managed by notificationsReducer
- `courses`: Contains the state managed by coursesReducer

Export the `rootReducer` as the default export of the module

**Requirements:**

No console warnings or errors

No lint errors

### 6.

In this task, you will configure a Redux store for a React application using the `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit

The store will use a root reducer to manage the overall state of the application

Use the `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit to create the Redux store and pass the `rootReducer` as the reducer property in the store configuration

Export the configured store as the default export of the module.

**Requirements:**

No console warnings or errors.

No lint errors in the code.

### 7.

In this task, you will update the `Header` component to use Redux for managing the authentication state

The updated Header will no longer receive `user` and `logOut` as props but will instead interact with the Redux store to determine the user’s authentication status and handle logout functionality

To achieve this make sure that:

- You retrieve the `isLoggedIn` and `user` state from the `auth` slice in the Redux store, using the appropriate hook
- You dispatch the `logout` action when the user clicks the logout link, using the appropriate hook:
  - Define a `handleLogout` function that triggers the logout action
- Render conditionally the logout section based on the `isLoggedIn` state
- Replace the `logOut` prop with the `handleLogout` function in the logout link’s onClick handler

### 8.

The same principle went for the `Header` component, goes here for the `Footer` component

The updated `Footer` will no longer receive `user` as a prop but will instead interact with the Redux `store` to determine the user’s authentication status and conditionally render the `Contact us`ink

To achieve this, make sure that:

- Use the appropriate hook to retrieve the `isLoggedIn` and `user` state from the `auth` slice in the Redux store
- Render the `Contact us` link conditionally based on the `isLoggedIn` state
- Remove the `user` prop from the Footer component and rely on the Redux store for state management
- Ensure the Footer component continues to display the copyright information and conditionally renders the “Contact us” link when the user is logged in

### 9.

In this task, you will update the `CourseList` component to use Redux for managing the `courses` state.

The updated CourseList will no longer receive courses as a `prop` but will instead interact with the Redux store to retrieve the list of courses

To achieve this, make sure that:

- Use the appropriate hook to retrieve the courses state from the courses slice in the Redux store
- Remove the courses prop from the CourseList component and rely on the Redux store for state management
- Ensure the CourseList component continues to display the `UI`
- Ensure the CourseList component remains wrapped in the `WithLogging` HOC

### 10.

In this task, you will update the `Login` component to dispatch the login action from the Redux store when the form is submitted.

Your task is to integrate Redux dispatch logic into the `useLogin` hook’s `onLogin` callback function

To achieve this, make sure that:

- Use the appropriate hook to dispatch the login action from the `auth` slice in the Redux store
- Pass the `login action` dispatch function to the useLogin hook as the onLogin callback
- The Login component must continue to use the useLogin hook for form state management and validation
- Remember that the submit button should start in a disabled state and only become enabled when both the email and the password are valid
- Remove the `login prop` from the Login component and rely on the Redux store for dispatching the login action

### 11.

In this task, you will update the `Notifications` component to use Redux for managing its state and actions.

The component will no longer rely on props for state and event handlers but will instead use the Redux `store` to manage the `displayDrawer` state, `notifications` list, and the actions `markNotificationAsRead`, `showDrawer`, and `hideDrawer`

To achieve this, make sure that:

- Remove the props from the Notifications component
- Use the appropriate hook to access the `notifications` and `displayDrawer` state from the Redux store
- Move the handlers `handleDisplayDrawer`, `handleHideDrawer`, and `markNotificationAsRead` from the App to Notifications component
- Replace the prop-based event of these handlers with Redux action dispatchers, and use the appropriate hook to dispatch the corresponding actions
- Ensure that the `markNotificationAsRead` action is dispatched with the correct notification id

**Requirements:**

The component should continue to display the list of notifications when the drawer is open

The “Close” button should hide the drawer when clicked

Clicking on a notification should mark it as read

Keep the Notifications component memoized using memo to optimize performance

### 12.

In this task, you will update the `App` component to use Redux for managing its authentication state `isLoggedIn` and dispatching side effects (fetching notifications and courses)

The component will no longer rely on local state or a custom reducer (`appReducer`) but on Redux state instead

To achieve this, make sure that:

- Delete the `useReducer` hook and the `appReducer` logic (remove the appReducer file too)
- Remove all prop-based event handlers (`logIn`, `logOut`, `handleDisplayDrawer`, `handleHideDrawer`, `markNotificationAsRead`)
- Use the appropriate hook to access the `isLoggedIn` state from the `auth` slice
- Use side effect to dispatch:
  - `fetchNotifications` when the component mounts
  - `fetchCourses` only when the user is logged in
- Conditionally render the `Login` or `CourseList` components based on the isLoggedIn state
- remove the `appReducer` file, and its related unit tests file

Don’t forget to wrap the App component with Redux `Provider` and pass the store

**Tests:**

Since Redux serves as a single source of truth for your application’s state, you will need to write unit tests for each component in isolation

Install necessary dependencies:

- Install [axios-mock-adapter](/rltoken/03-ZHNLuGVkhrX_CCY-CPg "axios-mock-adapter"), [redux-mock-store](/rltoken/9cYGHLfxk0Jgqi1T3g8EZQ "redux-mock-store") to mock API requests and redux store
